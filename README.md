# Coding-Quiz

## Description

My aim with this project was to create a quiz using JavaScript, DOM manipulation and local storage within the browser. This project gave me further experience in evaluating each step I need to take when developing each part of my webpage. I learned how to use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse to transfer data to and from the local storage, but also between JavaScript files, and using setInterval to create a timer for my quiz. I also learned to account for all kinds of situations, such as the user not typing in their initials and incurring a time penalty when an incorrect answer is clicked. One major lesson learned is using the console and data attributes to check variables being passed through functions when functions are not working as I would like them to.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Instructions:

Visit the [Coding Quiz](https://elenimg.github.io/Coding-Quiz/) webpage.

Click the 'Start Quiz' button to begin

Coding related questions will appear and you will need to answer all of them before the time runs out! If you get any questions wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted. Your final score will be the remaining amount of time.

Once you have finished the quiz, you have the option to add your initials and score to the leaderboard. Please ensure that you enter at least one initial as otherwise your score will not save.

To visit the leaderboard, click 'View Highscores' in the top left corner. Here, you can view the leaderboard as it stands or you can clear the scores to start from scratch!

Please see the following screenshots to see how the page works:
